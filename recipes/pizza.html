    <h3>Delicious and quick pizza recipe</h3>
    <h5>Ingredients you will need:</h5>
    <ul>
        <h6>For the pizza dough</h6>
        <li>355ml of warm water</li>
        <li>1 package of active dry yeast</li>
        <li>490g of bread flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <h6>For the pizza</h6> 
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Fontina, parmesan, feta and mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Mushrooms</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Proof the yeast:
            Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.
            After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.</li>
        <li>Make and knead the pizza dough:
            Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.
            
            Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.
            
            If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.
            
            The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.</li>
        <li>Let the dough rise: <br>
            Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.<br>
            At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with. <br>
            Cover the dough with plastic wrap. <br>
            For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2 hours. <br>
            For a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room temperature place (your kitchen counter will do fine) for 8 hours. For a longer rise, chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours).
            
            The longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust will have.</li>
        <li>Preheat the pizza stone (or pizza pan or baking sheet)</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 2 balls</li>
        <li>Prep the toppings</li>
        <li>Flatten the dough ball, and stretch out into a round</li>
        <li>Brush the dough top with olive oil</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the pizza peel with cornmeal, put flattened dough on top</li>
        <li>Spread with tomato sauce and sprinkle with toppings</li>
        <li>Cook</li>
        <li>Enjoy your pizza!</li>
    </ol>
